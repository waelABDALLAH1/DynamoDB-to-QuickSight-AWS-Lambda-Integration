# DynamoDB-to-QuickSight-AWS-Lambda-Integration
AWS Lambda for DynamoDB Export and QuickSight Integration



#Problem Description

Organizations frequently need to visualize and analyze their DynamoDB data using AWS QuickSight. However, preparing DynamoDB data for QuickSight can be cumbersome, involving several manual steps: exporting the data to S3, ensuring data freshness, and restructuring data into a format that QuickSight can easily consume. These processes often require significant manual effort and are prone to errors, which can lead to inefficiencies and delays in data analytics.

#Solution
This AWS Lambda function automates the export of DynamoDB tables to S3 and prepares the data for QuickSight visualization. It streamlines several key processes:

1. Automated Data Export: Automatically exports the specified DynamoDB table to an S3 bucket, leveraging DynamoDB's built-in export capabilities.
2. Cleanup of Old Exports: Cleans up old data in the specified S3 prefixes to manage storage costs effectively and ensure that only the most recent datasets are available for analysis.
3. Data Preparation for QuickSight: Copies the latest export to a fixed S3 path with a consistent naming structure. This step is crucial for integrating the data seamlessly into QuickSight, as it relies on consistent and predictable data paths and formats for efficient data sourcing and visualization.

#Objective
The primary goal of this Lambda function is to reduce the operational overhead associated with preparing and maintaining DynamoDB data for QuickSight analysis. By automating these tasks, the function helps ensure that data-driven insights are based on the most current data, with minimal manual intervention. This not only accelerates the time to insight but also enhances the accuracy and reliability of data visualizations and analyses in QuickSight.
